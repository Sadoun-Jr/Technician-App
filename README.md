## Known bugs:

1. The bottom navigator from the "github.com/Pyozer/introduction_screen" lib moves slightly up in
position when the next button is revealed for the first time, it is very minimal though and can be
solved by making the button transparent and not clickable
2. The picture of the issue isn't aligned properly in the orders page
3. Pressing back button after navigating from drawer returns you to prev screen with drawer open, 
need to close it.
4. Onboarding page loads list of appropriate technicians multiple times and repeats them
